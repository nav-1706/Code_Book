Prim's Algorithm --> greedy algorithm:

- Data structured needed: visited set, priority_queue<pair>, unordered map
- Insert the pair of < -1, src > int the priority_queue pq 
- one by onbe remove the root eleemnt of pq
- If the root element is already visited visited, then we will just continue
- We mark the root visited
- We will store the wt of the pair int the ans
- Update the mapping
- Go to every neighbour of the current element, add only those which are not visited and have a better weight proportion.
